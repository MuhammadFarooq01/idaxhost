# idaxhost.com Clone with React

Welcome to the idaxhost.com clone project! I am using React to replicate the idaxhost.com website, along with Tailwind CSS for styling. I code in it a little bit whenever I get some free time!

## Project Setup

This project provides a minimal setup to get React up and running, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules to keep our code clean.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadFarooq01/idaxhost.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd idaxhost
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For easy and responsive styling.
